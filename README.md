# Mad Libs Project

## Additional Challenge

**Save Your Story to a File:** Add functionality that asks the user if they want to save their
story to a text file. If yes, write the story to a file named by the user.

## Why I Chose This Challenge

I chose this challenge because AI rated it as the most complicated and I wanted to push myself.
While I had a basic understanding of how to complete the other challenges, I did not know how to
approach this one and saw it as an opportunity to learn something new.

## Reflection Questions - Part 1

**Which Python functions did you use to get input from the user?**  
The input() function was used to gather information from the user.

**How did f-string formatting help in constructing the story?**  
It allowed the variables to be embedded within the string. This is much easier than concatinating the strings manually.

**What would you change or add to your script if you wanted to make the game more interactive?**  
I would create additional stories that revolve around a specific theme.

## Reflection Questions - Part 2

**What was the most interesting or surprising part of implementing your chosen feature?**  
The most interesting part of saving the story to a text file was how easy it was!

**What was the greatest obstacle or bug you faced, and how did you overcome it?**  
I did not face any obstacles with the file-writing challenge. However, I did face several challenges while learning how to create new branches for working on a feature. Thankfully, I eventually figured it out and now feel confident in my ability to create and merge branches.

**How did the feature branch and merge workflow help in organizing your code changes?**  
The feature branch and merge workflow allowed me to write and test code independently without disrupting the main branch.

**What Python concepts do you feel more confident in after completing this assignment?**  
After completing this assignment, I feel more confident in working with file I/O in Python. I now have a solid understanding of how to open files and write data to them.
